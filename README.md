Performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle and Exploring the relationships between variables and identifying patterns and trends in the data.

# 🛳️ Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset.  
The goal is to explore relationships between features, visualize patterns, and extract meaningful insights.

## ⚡ Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, data types)
2. Descriptive Statistics
3. Univariate Analysis (distribution of features)
4. Bivariate Analysis (relationships between features)
5. Multivariate Analysis (correlations & heatmaps)
6. Insights & Conclusions

## 📊 Key Insights
- Women had higher survival chances.
- First-class passengers survived more than third-class.
- Younger passengers had higher chances of survival.
- Family size influenced survival probability.
